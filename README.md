Current state of the project is as follows:

Some bash files scripts (in /monitoring) enable to streamline iptables manipulation and (dis)allow or limitates client's use of the hotspot. The bash scripts can take as an argument a numbe rof bytes. In this case, a client is allowed to use the hotspot up to that level. 
Clients are identified by their MAC address.
The hotpost (DNS, DHCP etc.) is implemented using the create_ap project.
No transaction server has been yet created.
